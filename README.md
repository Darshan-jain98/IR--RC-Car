Remote Control Car with Arduino

This repository contains various files for an IR based RC car which is created on tinkercad

# Car Design
The remote control car makes use of IR sensor and IR remote for sending and receiving signals. The design provides the following functionality:

1.Move forward/Backward\
2.Stop/Turn\
3.Turn headlights on/off\
4.Automatically turn LED on to signal stop\
5.Increase and Decrease the speed of the car\
6. Automatically turn on the left/right indicator to signal the turn

# Working on:

1.Adding fan to prevent the car from heating up.\
2.Automatically turn headlights on during the night time.

# Simulate
The simulation on TinkerCad can be found [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/euDHKhmyCPV-rc-car20/editel). "Fork" this simulation to your TinkerCad and start tinkering!
